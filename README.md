# Deep Survival Model

This repo contains the tensorflow implementation of building a deep survival model. It is a deep learning extension of the framework proposed in the following paper:
> Yi Cui, Bailiang Li, and Ruijiang Li. "Decentralized Learning Framework of Meta-Survival Analysis for Developing Robust Prognostic Signatures." JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics 1 (2017): 1-13.

A step-by-step guide to use the codes is demonstrated in [template.ipynb](https://github.com/maycuiyan/deep-survival-model/blob/master/template.ipynb).

We provide various convenience functions to facilitate traning a **survival model** from multiple datasets. In particular,
